Daily Coding: Single Number

Problem Description:  Given an array of integers A, every element appears twice except for one. Find that integer that occurs once.

Solution : 

public class Solution {
    // DO NOT MODIFY THE ARGUMENTS WITH "final" PREFIX. IT IS READ ONLY
    public int singleNumber(final int[] A) {
        int n=A.length; // Stores the length of the input array A
        int ans=0; // Initialize a variable to store the result
        
        // Iterate through each element of the array
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            ans=ans^A[i]; // XOR operation between the current element and the result
        }
        
        return ans; // Return the single number that appears only once
    }
}

Explanation:

1. The class Solution contains a method named singleNumber, which takes an array of integers A as its argument and returns an integer.
2. The method is marked with final keyword, meaning the argument A cannot be modified within the method.
3. Inside the method, it first retrieves the length of the array A and stores it in the variable n.
4. It initializes a variable ans to 0, which will be used to store the result.
5. It then iterates through each element of the array using a for loop.
6. Within the loop, it performs the XOR operation (^) between the current value of ans and the current element of the array A[i]. XOR operation returns 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.
7. This operation essentially cancels out pairs of identical numbers, leaving only the number that appears once.
8. After the loop finishes, the method returns the value stored in ans, which is the single number that appears only once in the array.


This code efficiently finds the single number in the array using the XOR operation, which has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array. This solution is often used in programming interviews for its simplicity and efficiency.


Time Complexity: O(n) - Linear time complexity due to iterating through each element of the input array once.

Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space complexity as the amount of extra space used remains the same, regardless of the input size.
